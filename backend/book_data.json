In addition to exploring Newport’s ideas on how to eliminate distractions, this guide adds advice from other authors on how to work <em>despite</em> present distractions. We also include practical ways that everyday knowledge workers, not just academics like Newport, can prioritize deep work.</p>\n",

He lays out a systematic approach to innovation management involving the completion of seven innovation tasks. Kumar also discusses a number of specific tools and techniques you can use in the course of completing an innovation project.

Phelan explains that when you’re able to spend less time on discipline, you’ll have more time to focus on your more enjoyable parental duty: cultivating a warm and loving relationship with your child.</p>\n<p>Phelan’s approach will resonate with parents looking for a discipline model that builds children’s self-efficacy, self-esteem, and independence.

Leal argues that these communication errors are the most damaging to relationships. However, he claims you can avoid these mistakes and their negative outcomes by learning how to integrate empathy into every step of the communication process. In this guide, we’ll explore three important abilities that will allow you to do this: approaching conversations with empathy, listening with empathy, and expressing yourself with empathy. In our commentary, we’ll discuss other recommendations for communicating effectively from books like <em>Nonviolent Communication </em>(Marshall B. Rosenberg) and <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People </em>(Stephen Covey)<em>.</em></p>\n",

However, in <em>A First-Rate Madness</em>, psychiatrist Nassir Ghaemi argues that mental <em>illness</em> can make leaders better fit to lead during crises and that mental illness contributed to the successes of historical leaders such as Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. According to Ghaemi, if we better understand how conditions like depression and bipolar disorder can enhance leadership, we can lessen the cultural stigma surrounding mental illness.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll define mental health and explore how abnormal mental health has influenced successful leadership decisions during critical times of war and conflict. Finally, we’ll uncover the pitfalls of being a mentally well leader and how mental health treatment affects leadership. Along the way, we’ll compare Ghaemi’s arguments to those of other mental health experts and provide additional historical context.</p>\n",

What began as an endeavor to address his own unmet need quickly led to Sivers helping friends and other independent musicians sell their CDs online.

These are the lessons he learned along the way.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll look at Sivers’s recommendations for building a business that meets customers’ needs while still fulfilling your passions.

Many scientists and activists believe that the climate has already passed a tipping point and that environmental catastrophe is inevitable. In <em>Apocalypse Never</em>, award-winning science writer Michael Shellenberger says that it’s time to assess the crisis from a rational perspective. He argues that we’re in a much better position to curb climate change than alarmists would have us believe, and that people who bend scientific truth in order to spur environmental action are doing more harm than good.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll explain Shellenberger’s argument that environmental alarmists overstate their claims and that there’s ground for hope for our planet’s future. We’ll also look at counter-arguments to Shellenberger’s claims and examine what independent research says about the solutions he suggests. We’ll point to recent developments in industry, agriculture, and the political climate that frame the conversation around climate change.</p>\n",

While to some that may seem disheartening, science educator Neil deGrasse Tyson finds it exciting to know there’s so much left in the universe to discover. The study of astrophysics, he says, gives us a valuable perspective on ourselves while revealing the nature of the universe in which we live.</p>\n<p>Tyson explains in layman’s terms how physicists use the fundamentals of science and the full range of visible and invisible light to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos. He then goes on to cover the three biggest mysteries in astrophysics today—the origin of the universe, dark matter, and dark energy—while making a case for the benefits of understanding where we fit in the universal scheme. In this guide, we’ll also provide the historical context for astronomy’s groundbreaking discoveries and explain in more depth the current theories that are guiding astrophysics’ progress.</p>\n",

These are some of the questions 20th-century American philosopher John Rawls confronts in his 1971 work, <em>A Theory of Justice</em>. Rawls tries to determine how government can distribute rights, opportunities, wealth, and power using only reason and logic. The result is a theory of “justice as fairness,” which merges liberalism’s emphasis on equal rights and individualism with economic equality and safety nets for the most vulnerable members of society.</p>\n<p>We’ll explore how Rawls both defends and reimagines classic liberalism in a modern context, as well as how he defines an ideal government. In addition, we’ll examine critiques of his work, the intellectual basis for his arguments, and real-world examples of the politics he discusses.</p>\n",

In <em>A World Without Email, </em>Newport argues that email, and the relentless requests and distractions it introduces, makes knowledge workers less productive and more unhappy. Rather than dedicating focused time to the work they were hired to do, knowledge workers spend most of their days responding to and checking for unexpected requests which, because they’re part of a team, they feel pressured to fulfill immediately.</p>\n<p>Newport contends email doesn’t have to be the default way we work, and he proposes three solutions to get the most out of knowledge workers’ expertise while also making them happier employees: improving the workflows that govern how people work, improving the channels through which people communicate, and improving the quality of peoples’ working time. Alongside these recommendations, we’ll present the thoughts and approaches of other productivity thinkers and raise possible objections to some of Newport’s radical proposals.</p>\n",

McMaster, the United States views the world through a self-centered lens, assuming that its policy decisions are the main driving force behind global events. Because of this distorted perspective, the US has lost influence on the global stage at a time when authoritarian aggression is on the rise. In <em>Battlegrounds</em>, McMaster, who was US national security adviser in 2017-18, contends that American leaders must learn to see the world through the eyes of the US's adversaries in order to defend against foreign threats and compete in the modern global landscape.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll explore McMaster’s criticism of the assumptions driving US foreign policy, his assessment of the threats America faces, and the steps he believes the US must take. We’ll compare McMaster’s views with those of other experts on diplomacy, while placing his assessments in their larger context and updating some of his information based on events since the book’s publication.</p>\n",

White journalist John Howard Griffin darkened his skin to appear like a Black man, then traveled for six weeks throughout the segregated Southern US. Griffin predicted that he’d experience racial discrimination, and he hoped this outcome would convince white Americans that the US was <em>not</em> the racism-free country they thought it was. In <em>Black Like Me, </em>Griffin’s account of his journey, he argues that his hypothesis was correct:<strong> Black Southerners faced brutal racism.</strong></p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll describe Griffin’s experiences passing as a Black man and share his conclusions about Southern race relations. Throughout this guide, we’ll contextualize Griffin’s experiences and ideas by exploring the history of racism according to experts such as Ibram X. Kendi and Michelle Alexander. Furthermore, we’ll outline critics’ opinions of this controversial book. Finally, we’ll examine the relevance of Griffin’s ideas to life today.</p>\n",

Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne suggest that the answer to competitive problems is to create a <em>blue ocean</em>: a brand-new market for an innovative idea, allowing your company to avoid competing with rivals—because it has no direct rivals.</p>\n<p>In <em>Blue Ocean Strategy</em>, Kim and Mauborgne discuss how you can create such a market by focusing on your product’s characteristics that customers really care about while discarding the characteristics they don’t. This creates a new product offering that doesn’t currently exist, in a space without direct competitors.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll explore how to develop a blue ocean strategy, how to execute it, and how to anticipate potential problems. We’ll also look at how a blue ocean strategy aligns with other business strategy frameworks, and where it differs.</p>\n",

Science journalist James Nestor argues that while the power of the breath is central to many Eastern traditions, it’s been largely ignored in the Western world. Modern medicine treats chronic congestion, sinus infections, and lung disease but puts little emphasis on teaching people how to breathe correctly. However, Nestor asserts that by learning how to breathe well, we’ll improve our well-being, balance our emotions, and find more energy to live the lives we want.</p>\n<p>This guide will explain what Nestor says about how we’re breathing wrong, how we can do it better, and what amazing impact the power of breath can have over the body. We’ll also explore the underlying science of breath, hear what medical research says about Nestor’s claims, and delve into specific breathing techniques that the author recommends.</p>\n",

Bestselling author Jim Collins and Stanford professor Jerry I. Porras embarked on a six-year research project to answer this question.

The result is a groundbreaking study of the history of economic inequality and its implications for 21st-century society. Piketty argues that capitalism, by its nature, generates economic inequality because <strong>the rate of return on capital “r” has nearly always exceeded the rate of overall economic growth, “g.” In other words, r&gt;g. </strong>Piketty identifies r&gt;g as a fundamental economic law—and the key divergent and destabilizing force in capitalism.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll present Piketty’s ideas while also introducing commentary and analysis from other economists and writers who take a different view of inequality to provide a more balanced perspective.</p>\n",

Over the past 40 years, governments across the world have moved to market-based solutions by reducing marginal tax rates, eliminating tariffs, privatizing public monopolies, and introducing choice in public education.

Self-talk is the encouraging voice that tells you, “Nailed it!” after you rock an interview, as well as the inner cynic that grumbles, “You’re a failure” after you bomb a first date. In <em>Chatter</em>, neuroscientist and psychologist Ethan Kross highlights this last type of voice—negative self-talk, which he believes interferes with your happiness, health, and success. He argues that <strong>you can improve your life by quieting your negative self-talk. </strong></p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll present Kross’s insights on self-talk and share his research-based strategies for managing its negative form. For instance, you’ll learn why seeking support from others may make you feel <em>worse</em> and why feelings of amazement quiet your inner critic. Throughout this guide, we’ll compare Kross’s ideas and strategies to those of other experts on self-talk. Furthermore, we’ll provide additional actionable steps for quieting your negative self-talk.</p>\n",

Holiday argues that every person has the innate ability to be courageous. When you overcome fear and choose to do the right thing every day, you can effect positive change in the world. One of the most well-known modern-day philosophers, Holiday has written and co-written several bestselling books on Stoic philosophy, including <em>The Obstacle Is The Way, Ego Is the Enemy, </em>and<em> The Daily Stoic. </em></p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll discuss how Holiday defines courage and his advice for being courageous in both everyday and extraordinary situations. You’ll learn how to break free from fear, take control of your actions, and make bold decisions. In our commentary, we’ll discuss some of the philosophical principles behind Holiday’s ideas, alternative perspectives on courage, and actions you can take to incorporate more courage into your everyday life.</p>\n",

However, health economist Emily Oster argues in <em>Cribsheet </em>that <strong>there isn’t just <em>one</em> right way to parent a young child. </strong>What’s best for one family isn’t always best for another. She argues that you can discover the best parenting decisions for <em>your</em> family by<strong> consulting research and applying strategies from economics to your decision-making process.</strong></p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll explore Oster’s advice on making research-based parenting decisions. We’ll also present her research on some of the most important and controversial topics in parenting, from breastfeeding to potty training. Throughout our guide, we’ll contextualize Oster’s findings by exploring how social and cultural norms and stigmas influence parenting decisions.

We’ll also contextualize the book’s ideas using research on how culture and society influence decision-making.

            "blurb": "<p>What if there were a secret shortcut to elite performance and creative innovation? According to workplace performance psychologist Ron Friedman, there is—and it’s called <em>reverse engineering</em>. In <em>Decoding Greatness</em>, Friedman argues that <strong>the surest road to success is to take apart work you admire to see how it’s made, and then create your own version of it</strong>. By doing so, he says, you’ll spark original ideas, improve your skills, and ultimately find creative success.</p>\n<p>In our guide, we’ll explain Friedman’s advice for doing great work—whether that means getting a show at an art gallery, winning a marathon, or nailing a big product pitch. We’ll explore reverse engineering in depth and show you how to go from taking apart someone else’s work to creating your own. Then, we’ll discuss how to practice effectively and how to get useful feedback from peers and experts. We’ll also build on Friedman’s ideas by putting them in conversation with advice from creativity and performance experts such as Austin Kleon and Tim Ferriss.</p>\n",

Along the way, we’ll compare Hsieh’s ideas with those of other business experts like Jim Collins (<em>Good to Great</em>) and psychologists like Jonathan Haidt (<em>The Happiness Hypothesis</em>).

            "blurb": "<p>In <em>Doughnut Economics</em>, heterodox University of Oxford economist Kate Raworth argues that the economy’s purpose is to promote human prosperity and happiness. This means 1) an economy that produces enough to provide everyone with the material resources to pursue their highest dreams, but also 2) an economy that does not deplete the vital natural resources upon which life on the planet depends. She likens the economy to a ring-shaped doughnut. The inner circle represents the zone of deprivation—an economy that does not produce enough of the necessary goods and services to meet the population’s essential needs. The outer circle represents the limits of economic growth, beyond which the economy begins to outstrip the planet’s natural resources. She writes that we must stay within these bounds.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we have incorporated commentary and insights from other economists, political scientists, and social commentators—in some cases to lend support to Raworth’s ideas, in other cases to present opposing viewpoints and offer a more nuanced and balanced perspective.</p>\n",

The vast majority of adults are caught in an unfulfilling cycle of consumerism: They sell decades of their lives to employers so they can buy consumable goods and status symbols that don’t make them happy. Luckily, Fisker says, it’s possible to break out of this system: He did this by learning how to survive on just $7,000 a year, which allowed him to permanently retire at age 33. In <em>Early Retirement Extreme,</em> he teaches others how to do the same.</p>\n<p>In this guide, you’ll learn the basic principles of Fisker’s frugal mindset and how you, too, can retire at an extremely early age. In our commentary, we’ll examine popular ideas from the early retirement community that provide intellectual context for Fisker’s argument and help you save even more money. We’ll also highlight counterpoints to Fisker’s point of view from books including <em>168 Hours</em> and <em>I Will Teach You to Be Rich</em>.</p>\n",

Westover gains the strength to break free from the ideological chains of her youth and discovers the agency to make her own choices about how she sees and experiences the world.</p>\n<p>While it is about one individual’s journey, <em>Educated</em> speaks to universal themes of self-liberation, the power of education, the perils of extreme ideology, and the trauma of domestic abuse.</p>\n",

In <em>Effortless</em>, he expands on this one simple truth: Achieving your goals doesn’t have to be so hard. By simply taking the easiest path, we can be healthier, happier, and more productive.</p>\n<p>In our guide, we’ll lay out McKeown’s argument that the easiest path to success is the most viable, and we’ll provide actionable advice on how to implement this idea into your daily life.

He notes that many successful people are famously egotistical, and he contends that as a result, society tends to think that ego is an important ingredient in success, as if <em>ego</em> leads to <em>accomplishment</em>. However, Holiday argues that <strong>ego leads far more often to <em>failure</em>, and that people find success only when they’re able to control their egotistical impulses. </strong></p>\n<p>To make his arguments, Holiday draws on the philosophies of Stoic thinkers, advising us to resist the urges of our emotions in order to maintain clarity of thinking. In our guide to his book, we’ll examine his theories through the lens of Stoicism, and we’ll compare them to other management theories that similarly aim to help you find success.</p>\n",

This is the true story of the <em>Endurance </em>crew, written in 1959 by journalist Alfred Lansing, using primary sources such as the crew members’ diaries and interviews with survivors.</p>\n<p>This guide recounts their journey home against impossible odds, adds context on the Antarctic environment and history, and provides further diary excerpts that help complete the picture of the journey as the men experienced it. We also examine Shackleton’s successes and failures and what modern-day leaders can learn from him.</p>\n",

When leaders execute effectively and are actively involved in the company at ground level, they create a performance-oriented culture and keep everyone’s efforts focused on the goals that matter most.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll review Bossidy and Charan’s principles for powerful leadership and consider other authors’ ideas that support (and sometimes challenge) their assertions.

Instead, Lomborg outlines several more modest recommendations that, he claims, represent the best approach to climate change.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll discuss Lomborg’s arguments about the impact of climate change, along with his assessments of unsuccessful approaches to climate change and his suggestions for alternatives.

We’ll explain how fungi work to connect the plant life in the forests, how “Mother Trees” take care of their communities and their offspring, and why the prevailing competition paradigm is shortsighted. Throughout, we’ll look at other research that supports or challenges Simard’s findings and discuss how this “new” paradigm of cooperation is not new at all—it’s been the prevailing model for understanding nature among indigenous peoples throughout history.</p>\n",

That you’re constantly checking things off your to-do list but still don’t have enough time for the important things? <strong>Your problem might be that you’re doing a lot, but not doing the right things.</strong></p>\n<p>In <em>First Things First, </em>Stephen R. Covey, author of <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, </em>presents a time management approach that focuses on priorities, or “first things.” This approach teaches you to use your time <em>effectively </em>instead of just <em>efficiently</em>—in other words, focusing on what you spend your time on, rather than just how much time you spend per task. You’ll learn how to identify your priorities, schedule your time at the daily and weekly levels, and collaborate with others to ensure the best possible results for everyone.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we link Covey’s ideas to books and articles about leadership, spirituality, and even biology to help you determine what’s most important to you and why. We also include connections to other self-help books and business strategy guides to help you maximize your potential, both individually and as part of a group.</p>\n",

Instead, people must accept that they’ll never get as much done as they’d like and work within the parameters of a finite life.

But Matthew Perry’s role as Chandler on the iconic show <em>Friends </em>is a lot closer to reality than you might have imagined. In <em>Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</em>, Perry shares his story of battling loneliness, health scares, and the big terrible thing: addiction. His hope is that it will help others who are also struggling with substance abuse know they are not alone in their challenges, and that, if he could get sober, they can, too.</p>\n<p>This guide explores the evolution of three major themes throughout Perry’s life: his addiction, struggles in establishing relationships, and his search for fame. We also contextualize the events and struggles of his life within psychological theories about childhood trauma, attachment theory, and the nature of addiction and recovery.</p>\n",

Berne explains how most of us don’t even notice our games, and how we’re missing out on the fulfillment of game-free living.</p>\n<p>In our guide, we’ll explore the foundations of Berne’s theory and build up to an extensive discussion of games, before finishing with his strategies for growing into a fuller way of living.

Through detailed case studies of 11 companies that went from tracking the market to exceeding it by at least 3x, Collins presents the key factors that separate merely good organizations from great ones—from rare leadership to disciplined thinking to the dogged pursuit of a core mission.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re an entrepreneur, a manager, or just an individual looking to improve, the concepts in <em>Good to Great</em> provide food for thought—and spurs to action. You’ll learn what it takes to be a “Level 5” leader, why assembling the right team first is more important than having the right idea, why you should be more like a hedgehog than a fox, and why “stop doing” lists are as important as “to do” lists.</p>\n",

Part autobiography and part life-guide, <em>Greenlights</em> both explains and illustrates McConaughey’s philosophy of “catching greenlights”—recognizing and even creating those moments when life says “yes” and you cruise into success as you pursue your destiny.

In this guide, we’ll cover Enders's ideas on topics like where the food you eat goes, what your appendix <em>actually </em>does, and how tiny organisms in your intestines influence your immune system (and possibly your mood). We’ll fact-check Enders’s claims about the gut and elaborate further on the organs in this system. We’ll also discuss studies that have updated our scientific knowledge of the gut since the book’s publication.</p>\n",

Derren Brown suggests that the answers can be found in the teachings of the ancient Greek philosophers for whom the quest for a happy, well-lived life was a practical problem to be solved. Brown says that by adopting a philosophy based on those of the Stoics and Epicureans, we can lead thoughtful, balanced, and more well-rounded lives.</p>\n<p>As a magician, Brown isn’t a stereotypical self-help guru. However, his understanding of how stories misdirect us led to his belief that we can reshape our own narratives to be happy in the here and now while maintaining a positive outlook toward our own mortality. This guide will examine Brown’s definition of happiness and the philosophical building blocks he claims can achieve it. We’ll compare Brown’s ideas to those of modern psychology and contrast his views with those of other happiness experts, some of whom he argues directly against.</p>\n",

A university dropout, once so poor that he scavenged for food, Bartlett founded the successful internet company Social Chain at age 21 and was by all objective accounts “living the dream.” But when wealth and fame didn’t bring him happiness, Bartlett reevaluated his priorities.

Are we doomed to suffer the fate of other 21st-century democracies, like Hungary, Venezuela, and Turkey, where true democracy ceased to exist? By what processes was democracy killed in those and other countries—and how might we prevent it here?</p>\n",

Contrary to popular belief, humans aren’t at the mercy of animal emotions. We play a role in creating our own emotions—and we bear the responsibility for our emotional behavior.</p>\n",

As a result, despite being Black, he was racist himself throughout much of his life. In <em>How to Be an Antiracist, </em>he describes how he changed his thoughts and actions to become antiracist, and how you can do the same. Our commentary explores how racism became so deeply ingrained in our culture and why it’s so hard for us to let go of our racist ideas on an individual level. We’ll also suggest some specific ways you can implement Kendi’s ideas and start taking antiracist action.</p>\n",

The ideas in this book can shift that dynamic and show the child you’re on their side. Instead of getting locked in power struggles, you can work together to solve problems.

Thus, although a nation may consist of tens of millions of people—nearly all of whom will never personally know or even meet one another—nationalism allows each individual to think of themselves as a member of a singular community with a shared identity.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ve added alternative viewpoints on the basis of nationalism, including psychological and anthropological perspectives.

Armed with this advice, the authors say that you have everything you need to meet any goal.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll show how the authors’ arguments about influencing human behavior are rooted in psychology, touching on multiple theories of behavior change.  We’ll also supplement the author’s recommendations with advice from other behavior change books like <em>Atomic Habits</em> by James Clear, <em>Awaken the Giant Within</em> by Tony Robbins, and <em>High Performance Habits </em>by Brendan Burchard.</p>\n",

            "blurb": "<p>When you read the words “average person,” who do you picture? Most people picture a man. In her best seller <em>Invisible Women</em>, feminist campaigner Caroline Criado Perez explains that this is because most humans operate on a male-as-default mindset: We think the average person is <em>male</em>. This mindset leads to and is reinforced by a gender data gap—a lack of information about the female experience—that ultimately harms women’s health, safety, and economic standing.</p>\n<p>In this guide, you’ll learn how our male-as-default mindset leads us to create cars and medicines that put women’s health at risk. You’ll also discover how this mindset both results in and stems from a gender data gap that harms women’s economic standing. Finally, you’ll learn how our lack of consideration for gender-specific concerns harms women’s safety everywhere from trains to refugee camps—and ultimately reinforces the male-as-default mindset. Along the way, we’ll provide recent data that sheds further light on the gender data gap and examine how countries and institutions have tried to remedy it.</p>\n",

In this case, the question to ask is not “What’s wrong with me?” but “Where did this come from?”</p>\n<p>In <em>It Didn’t Start With You</em>, Mark Wolynn says the source of your suffering may lie hidden in your unconscious, where traumas from your past—and your family’s past—are stopping you from being truly happy and free. Wolynn shares the latest research to reveal how traumas get passed biologically from one generation to the next. He also describes how you can uncover and resolve deeply-rooted trauma by applying his unique therapeutic approach. By doing so, he says, you can reprogram your body, stop suffering, and start living a life you love.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll examine research that expands upon Wolynn’s claims. We’ll also consider viewpoints that challenge some of his arguments, such as the importance of reconciling with our parents and the limited effectiveness of talk therapy in treating trauma.</p>\n",

However, allowing shame to control our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors wreaks major havoc on our health, happiness, and relationships. In <em>I Thought It Was Just Me (but it isn’t)</em>, Brown contends that to live a happy, empowered life—and help others to do the same—you must combat shame by practicing empathy toward yourself and others.</p>\n<p>This guide will explain what shame is, why it happens, how it impacts our lives, and the techniques and skills we can use to build empathy and combat shame. Throughout the guide, we’ll explore other expert opinions on the causes and impact of shame. We’ll also compare Brown’s ideas to similar concepts in books like <em>The Power of Now</em> by Eckhart Tolle and <em>Radical Acceptance </em>by Tara Brach.</p>\n",

To illustrate these failures, Stevenson discusses numerous criminal cases, most prominently the 1989 case of Walter McMillian, a Black man wrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to death in Alabama.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll discuss Stevenson’s analysis of the McMillian case and his evidence of extreme punishments doled out more broadly by the justice system. Moreover, we’ll consider Stevenson’s diagnosis of the root problems with the American conception of justice and his suggestions for repairing it. We’ll also examine arguments from other sources about how to improve the justice system and provide further context for the cases that Stevenson cites.</p>\n",

In <em>Leadership Is Language</em>, former Navy captain L. David Marquet argues that answers lie in the <em>language</em> that leaders use to communicate to their team—language that discourages workers from voicing their opinions. Marquet provides a new approach to leadership that empowers workers to play an active role in decision-making. By adopting Marquet’s strategies, you can transform your organization into an adaptive, innovative, and high-performing workplace led by engaged and passionate workers.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll explain why traditional leadership language is ineffective in the modern workplace and examine Marquet’s approach to better leadership communication. Along the way, we’ll supplement Marquet’s insights with the perspectives of other leadership and communication experts.</p>\n",

Phillips doesn’t just focus on <em>what</em> Lincoln did—he also focuses on <em>how</em> he did it.</p>\n<p>In our guide to <em>Lincoln on Leadership</em>, we’ll explore the main components of Lincoln’s leadership style that Phillips identifies in the book: how he communicated, acted ethically, and made his decisions. We’ll also provide historical context and alternative perspectives on Lincoln and leadership through our commentary.</p>\n",

However, could it be that in giving up those stories, we’ve lost a crucial part of the human experience? In <em>Maps of Meaning</em>, Jordan Peterson argues that mythology provides a psychological tool that helps us create meaning in a chaotic world. Beneath their fanciful trappings, creation stories and heroic quests give us the moral foundations of society and the tools for adapting to life’s challenges. Perhaps even more importantly, myths teach us to recognize our individual capacity for good and evil.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll examine Peterson’s arguments on how myth affects the mind, mythology’s fundamental archetypes and stories, and how to apply the lessons of myth to live a more well-rounded life. We’ll also look at alternative interpretations of mythological stories, what science says about the intersection of myth and cognitive development, as well as how the symbols of myth have taken new form in the stories of today.</p>\n",

Understanding and adjusting your mindset can change your career, relationships, the way you raise your children, and your overall life satisfaction.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we explore Dweck’s mindset theory, most notably the nature vs. nurture debate. We connect her ideas with other self-help books to further explore the damage a fixed mindset causes and the benefits of a growth mindset. Finally, we link to practical tools and techniques to help you learn how to overcome a fixed mindset and embrace taking chances and making mistakes.</p>\n",

They examine several unconscious processes we use to reduce the discomfort of cognitive dissonance, including self-justification, confirmation bias, and memory distortion. By learning about these psychological processes, you can unlock awareness of them in your own life and begin taking accountability for your actions.</p>\n<p>In this guide, you’ll learn how contradictory thoughts and behaviors create painful dissonance.

Taylor’s newfound capacity for empathy and stillness redefined her awareness of herself and the world, and led her to believe that we can all find that peace if we become aware of how our brains function and consciously tap its hidden resources.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll cover Taylor’s account of her stroke, her recovery, and her insights on mental and emotional self-care.

He calls these messages <em>myths</em>.</p>\n<p>According to Barthes, Myths occur when society’s dominant institutions—the government, the advertising industry, or Hollywood, to name a few—imbue an image, object, or phrase with meaning. By creating these associations, the dominant social institutions create and reinforce cultural beliefs and values that are unconsciously adopted by the masses. <em>Mythologies </em>aims to open our eyes to these manipulations and teach us how to avoid them.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll discuss Barthes’s theoretical framework behind myth, examine some of the examples he gives from 1950s French culture, and consider whether they’re still present in contemporary culture today.</p>\n",

Why does one job candidate get hired when an equally qualified candidate isn’t even interviewed? The answer, according to Daniel Kahneman (<em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>), Olivier Sibony, and Cass R. Sunstein (<em>Nudge</em>), is <strong><em>noise</em>—unexpected and unwanted variance in human judgments</strong>. Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein argue that understanding and counteracting this kind of noise is key to improving the judgments that affect some of the most important aspects of our lives, including our justice system, medical care, education, and business decisions.</p>\n<p>Drawing on decades of research and their own experiences as noise consultants, the authors explain what noise is, where it comes from, and how we can reduce it to make our world more fair and consistent. In this guide, we’ll elaborate on the concept of noise by connecting it to the authors’ previous work and to similar ideas in fields ranging from financial trading to baseball scouting.</p>\n",

She contends that most marketers don’t fully understand what positioning is or its vital importance to selling. This gap in knowledge is a huge disadvantage to any product because without proper positioning, customers can’t understand why they should bother to buy it.</p>\n<p>To fill this knowledge gap, Dunford proposes a 12-step process—taking you all the way from creating a cross-departmental positioning group to sharing your final positioning across the company—that lets you position any product well. We’ll supplement her recommendations with actionables that allow you to implement her advice, as well as alternative perspectives on positioning and selling from other marketing and sales experts.</p>\n",

But by implementing Paul’s organizational strategies and systems—which involve containing messes, sorting through inboxes, and managing projects—ADHDers can gain control over their lives and find greater peace.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll first explain what ADHD is and how it affects cognitive functioning. Then, we’ll move on to the first step of getting organized, which is to get to know yourself and how your ADHD affects you personally, followed by the second step, which is to contain your current state of disorganization, and finally the third step, which is to implement your organizational system. We’ll add information about how ADHD works and the other traits that accompany it, as well as advice from other experts on how to stay organized.</p>\n",

According to Seth Godin in <em>Permission Marketing</em>, there’s a better way for brands to get the attention of potential customers. Instead of resorting to intrusive marketing that consumers are <em>forced</em> to see, it’s possible to create marketing that consumers <em>ask </em>to see. By doing so, you can build a loyal customer base at a fraction of the cost of a traditional marketing campaign.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll discuss how the world of marketing has transformed over the last several decades, and we’ll examine why the old model of intrusive advertising is no longer profitable. Additionally, we’ll explore the three steps to building and profiting from a permission marketing campaign. In our commentary, we’ll paint a more complete picture of Godin’s perspective on marketing, referencing ideas from his other books. We’ll also offer supplementary advice for running a permission marketing campaign from books like <em>How Brands Grow</em> and <em>Dotcom Secrets</em>.</p>\n",

We’ll also describe why higher levels of consciousness create positive outcomes for both you and the world. Our commentary will compare Hawkins’s ideas to influential religious and spiritual teachings, particularly those of Hinduism and yoga. We’ll also examine his ideas through a scientific lens, showing how the core ideas in <em>Power vs. Force </em>echo concepts in psychology and animal behavior.</p>\n",

You’ll also learn how geography shapes the way that nations interact with each other. On the international stage, Marshall argues, nations use trade, diplomacy, and military force as they vie for access to geographical bounties—troves of resources, trade routes, and defensive features. As we cover Marshall’s ideas, we’ll consider a variety of perspectives on the role of geography in politics. We’ll also contrast these views with those of historians who argue that other forces, such as economics and culture, have been more influential in shaping history.</p>\n",

            "blurb": "<p>According to author and lecturer Dale Carnegie, public speaking is the one skill that can bring you more success, opportunity, and fulfillment than any other. In <em>Public Speaking for Success</em>, Carnegie argues that as a skilled speaker, you'll be able to change people's hearts and minds, inspire action, improve your relationships, and advance your career. Most people fear speaking in public, but that’s only natural—and with Carnegie’s time-tested lessons, you can learn to overcome that fear, take the stage, and speak with confidence and poise.</p>\n<p>Our guide is based on the updated 2006 edition of <em>Public Speaking for Success</em> (originally published in 1926). We share Carnegie’s essential teachings about why public speaking matters, how to overcome the fear of getting on stage, and how to craft and deliver a memorable speech. In commentary, we’ll explore how speech-giving has changed since Carnegie’s time and compare his ideas to those in two popular books on TED talks.</p>\n",

This means we misunderstand what addiction is, what causes it, and how to treat it, especially for women.</p>\n<p>Whitaker offers an alternative take on alcohol addiction. She explains how alcohol is always bad for you and how alcohol companies perpetuate the belief that you should be able to enjoy alcohol in moderation.

The way you think and feel about your life experiences determines which one of these infinite versions of reality exists for <em>you</em>. Therefore, <strong>consciously choosing the way you think and feel allows you to control which version of reality you live in</strong>.</p>\n<p>This guide explores Zeland’s thoughts on the nature of reality, your role in shaping it, and what you can do to take control of it.

Cognitively diverse groups, he argues, can harness the diverse knowledge of their members, leading to increased performance and innovative ideas.

In <em>Scarcity,</em> behavioral science researchers Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir explain how scarcities of time and money temporarily change our brains: They make us more efficient with a limited resource in the short term, but they also decrease our mental bandwidth, distorting the way we process information and make decisions. This not only exacerbates scarcity, but it also takes a huge toll on other areas of our lives, like health, relationships, and work.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll explore both the good and bad sides of scarcity: how it enables us to work at a superhuman pace as a deadline approaches and how our decreased mental bandwidth digs us deeper into scarcity. We’ll discuss strategies to counteract the negative cognitive effects of scarcity, why poverty is a unique scarcity, and how we can design better social programs to alleviate poverty. We’ll also include recommendations from other authors about managing limited time and money.</p>\n",

According to Eker, <strong>you can dramatically improve your finances </strong>by taking conscious control of your thoughts and <em>adopting a rich attitude</em> that will inspire you to take new actions that lead to your financial success.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ve reorganized Eker’s ideas into three distinct parts that walk you through his philosophy and give you actionable advice on developing a richer mindset.

This entails understanding that you—like all people—make mistakes and suffer, are intrinsically worthy of care and comfort, and are connected to others through your suffering.</p>\n<p>Neff is a pioneer in self-compassion research, whose tenets are rooted in  Buddhist psychology. She’s the co-founder of the nonprofit Center for Mindful Self-Compassion, co-developer of the Mindful Self-Compassion training and workbook, and author of <em>Fierce Self-Compassion: How Women Can Harness Kindness to Speak Up, Claim Their Power, and Thrive</em> (2021). <em>Self-Compassion </em>was published in 2015.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll examine Neff’s definition of self-compassion and explore the key practices, benefits, and obstacles to embracing it. We’ll also explain how self-compassion can improve your relationship with others, making you a better partner and parent. We’ll also expand on Neff’s claims by comparing them with ideas and advice from other spiritual, psychology, medical, and public health experts.</p>\n",

In <em>Sex at Dawn</em>, Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá (a husband-and-wife team) offer a surprising answer: For most of our evolutionary history, humans lived in societies that encouraged casual sex with multiple partners. According to the authors, humans evolved to be naturally promiscuous and only reluctantly embraced monogamy about 10,000 years ago when we stopped foraging for food and started farming.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll learn why everything we think we know about prehistoric human sexuality is wrong. We’ll draw on evidence from great apes (our closest evolutionary cousins), remote hunter-gatherer societies, and modern human biology to show that humans evolved to be promiscuous, <em>not </em>monogamous.

However, Matthew Dicks argues that most of us end up being mediocre because we see our goals as <em>abstract</em> and <em>distant</em>—things we <em>might</em> be able to achieve <em>at some point</em>, but not right now. This mindset makes us delay taking action toward our goals, and consequently, we never reach them. In <em>Someday Is Today</em>, Dicks argues that achieving your dreams and overcoming mediocrity <em>is</em> possible, but only if you start acting <em>now</em>.</p>\n<p>This guide will explore Dicks’s tips for accomplishing extraordinary things. We’ll discuss how to maximize your time, efficiency, productivity, and creative potential so you can make the most of your life and become as successful as possible, as soon as possible. In our commentary, we’ll supplement Dicks’s recommendations with input from other productivity and creativity experts like Brené Brown (<em>Daring Greatly)</em> and Tiago Forte (<em>Building a Second Brain).</em></p>\n",

With candor and humor, he provides a step-by-step procedure for interrupting negative thoughts, generating positive thoughts, and turning those positive thoughts into genuine beliefs.</p>\n<p>In our guide, we’ll start by defining overthinking. We’ll examine how overthinking can negatively impact your productivity and consider the biological reasons we tend to focus on negative thoughts. Then, we’ll go through Acuff’s process for overcoming overthinking, providing examples that help illustrate how to apply each step in your own life. We’ll also include commentary that provides psychological context for Acuff’s ideas, as well as contrast those ideas against other notable approaches to self-improvement.</p>\n",

That’s the central question of Ibram X. Kendi’s <em>Stamped from the Beginning</em>, which argues that contrary to common wisdom, racism doesn’t begin with prejudice and hatred—it begins with self-serving policies whose proponents justify their actions by inventing racist ideas. Kendi, an African American Studies scholar, develops this claim by analyzing the history of racist ideas in the United States and offering readers a better understanding of how to combat contemporary racism.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll explore such insights as how enslavers convinced themselves that slavery benefited slaves and why most antiracist reformers harbored racist thoughts. Along the way, we’ll make connections between this book and Kendi’s later writings, and we’ll expand upon, and sometimes challenge, Kendi’s ideas by referring to other prominent writers on race such as Robin DiAngelo and Jennifer Eberhardt.</p>\n",

He examines these forces, including everything from our food to the economy, and unlike other authors writing about distraction, he proposes societal solutions rather than individual tips.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll explore Hari’s evidence of an attention crisis, the seven factors causing this crisis, and his three-part solution. We’ll also share suggestions for action based on Hari’s insights, as well as explore perspectives from other authors that complement his ideas.</p>\n",

In <em>Stop Overthinking</em>, Nick Trenton explains that you were probably <em>overthinking</em> the problem: reflecting on it so much that it made you feel bad. He argues that by adopting stress management skills and replacing your negative thought habits with a positive mental framework, you can stay grounded in the present moment and live a productive life driven by action and control rather than endless worrying.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll discuss what overthinking is and how it’s connected to stress and anxiety. Then, we’ll explore ways you can manage stress before, during, and after it happens with various research-based techniques. Finally, we’ll show how you can reshape your negative thinking habits into positive ones. Along the way, we’ll compare Trenton’s strategies with those of other coaches and thinkers such as Tony Robbins (<em>Awaken the Giant</em>) and Judson Brewer (<em>Unwinding Anxiety</em>), and offer additional actionable insights to overcome your negative thought patterns.</p>\n",

However, screenwriter and storytelling expert Robert McKee argues that stories’ emotional power is not only explainable but also something you can learn to create. In <em>Story</em>, McKee breaks down how stories function and uses this theory to explain how you can write a gripping story. The book is intended for screenwriters, but its principles apply to any kind of storytelling.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll explain what ingredients enable stories to engage audiences on both an emotional and intellectual level. You’ll learn how “beats” of action and reaction act as the driving force of compelling scenes and how scenes, sequences, and acts fit together to form stories that hold attention. We’ll provide background from earlier works that likely inspired <em>Story</em>, such as Joseph Campbell’s <em>The Hero With a Thousand Faces</em>. We’ll also supplement McKee’s writing advice with tips from other popular books, such as Stephen King’s <em>On Writing</em> and Blake Snyder’s <em>Save the Cat!</em></p>\n",

In <em>Stumbling on Happiness</em>, award-winning Harvard professor Daniel Gilbert offers an explanation for what are, in his view, unavoidable poor decisions: You fabricate a large part of your reality—your memories of the past, perception of the present, and vision of the future. When you then use these inaccurate perceptions of the future, present, and past to make choices about what to do in the future, your choices are often poor and hinder future happiness.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll walk through Gilbert’s thesis, describing how your brain works and how its fabrication of reality leads you to make six specific types of bad decisions about your future. We’ll also link Gilbert’s ideas to other, related areas of human cognition. Finally, while Gilbert claims you can’t counteract your tendency to make poor decisions about your future, we’ll offer suggestions on how to improve your decision-making as much as possible.</p>\n",

In this guide, we’ll explore the traits and tactics that make superforecasters so “super” and how you can use them to improve your own predictions.

By using their approach, you can ensure that your organization’s teams are able to work together to create software that exceeds expectations both internally and in the marketplace.</p>\n<p>In our guide, we’ll first consider how Skelton and Pais’s approach to software development is influenced by Conway’s Law, which states that a piece of software’s architecture will mimic the structure of the team that produced it. Then, we’ll look at the four types of teams Skelton and Pais recommend dividing your workforce into. Finally, we’ll look at the three ways your teams can most effectively work together. We’ll also supplement the authors’ approaches with other ideas on how to design teams and effectively delegate work to them.</p>\n",

The book asserts that American history began in 1619 with the arrival of the first ship of enslaved Africans, one year before the Mayflower arrived. It also argues that, American democracy and the prosperous nation we know today were largely built by enslaved Black Americans but that this demographic is almost entirely excluded from America’s founding stories and remains suppressed today due to racist institutions that persist from slavery.</p>\n<p>This guide will reframe America’s founding story by exploring how the institution of slavery has impacted our economy, laws, society, and the livelihoods of Black Americans. We’ll conclude by discussing Hannah-Jones’s recommendations for how the government can make reparations for these injustices. Throughout the guide, we’ll provide a broader perspective by discussing accounts from other historians, economists, and researchers.</p>\n",

When you apply <strong>focus, leverage, engagement, and accountability,</strong> not only will you execute your strategies, you’ll create permanent behavioral changes as a leader and an organization.</p>\n<p>In this guide we’ll connect the authors’ ideas with those from other popular self-help and business guides such as <em>Awaken the Giant Within </em>and <em>Smarter Faster Better </em>in order to provide a well-rounded view of the theories and techniques of <em>The 4 Disciplines</em> <em>of Execution</em>.

This natural fearfulness developed to help us survive in ancient times, but in modern times, we rarely face life-threatening situations where it’s warranted. As a result, our fearfulness only holds us back from gaining power and success. Jackson and Greene argue that you must become <em>fearless</em> to truly thrive.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll start by explaining how Jackson’s fearlessness helped him overcome his hardships and achieve power and success. Next, we’ll discuss the rules Jackson and Greene say are necessary to follow to become fearless and principles that’ll help you follow each one. In our commentary, we’ll supplement Jackson and Greene’s advice with recommendations from other experts on success, like Daniel Walter (<em>The Power of Discipline</em>). We’ll also compare the ideas in this book to those in some of Greene’s previous works, including <em>The 48 Laws of Power.</em></p>\n",

According to this 80/20 Principle, only a fraction of the actions you take and the people you interact with contribute to your joy and success. Therefore, Koch says you must spend more time on what matters, and less time on what doesn't—for example, by finding work you enjoy, spending less time on things you're not good at, and avoiding people who drain your energy.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll examine the mindset changes Koch says you must make to take advantage of the 80/20 Principle and achieve success. We’ll also explore the scientific research behind key principles, such as how to revolutionize your view of time and the link between happiness and productivity.</p>\n",

In <em>The Advice Trap</em>, coaching expert Michael Bungay Stanier explains that advice-giving can lead to more problems than solutions and encourages you, instead, to adopt a coaching style of leadership. Stanier argues that when you learn to approach difficult conversations with questions instead of suggestions, you’ll unlock the full potential of your team and relieve yourself of unnecessary burdens.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll look at three ways of thinking that drive people to give advice and why Stanier believes it to be a counterproductive leadership approach. We’ll also explore how to subdue that compulsion and how adopting a questions-first approach can foster a more confident, effective, and growth-driven team. Along the way, we’ll explore insights from other experts and compare them with Stanier’s arguments.</p>\n",

Have you ever gone to a wedding and felt there was something missing?</p>\n<p>Experiences like these inspired Priya Parker, an expert on gatherings, to write <em>The Art of Gathering</em>. Parker contends that pre-planned gatherings of all types—both business and personal—<em>could</em> be more meaningful experiences than they usually are. She presents a step-by-step guide to transforming your gathering into a meaningful event that people will talk about for years.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll discuss what to do <em>before</em> a gathering to set the stage for a potentially transformative experience. Then, we’ll talk about how to begin the gathering and dispel misconceptions—like the idea that hosts should relax—that result in boring or unpleasant gatherings. Finally, we’ll share how to end the gathering in a more meaningful way. We’ll also discuss what other experts say about gathering well and share ways to apply Parker’s tips to virtual or hybrid gatherings.</p>\n",

He believes that this failure to truly achieve loving connection is why so many people are unhappy, despite having all their basic needs met. However, if we can learn how to genuinely love others, we’ll be happier and less isolated.</p>\n<p><em>The Art of Loving </em>was originally published in 1956, but many of its lessons are just as relevant today as they were in the 20th century. In this guide, we’ll begin by examining Fromm’s ideas on the purpose of love. Then, we’ll examine the types of false love that people often mistake for genuine love. Finally, we’ll learn what genuine love looks like and how to practice it. Throughout the guide, we’ll compare Fromm’s ideas about love to those of other philosophers and psychologists and add some additional nuances he may not have considered.</p>\n",

Along the way, we’ll compare and contrast Dobelli’s ideas with other experts on logical thinking, such as Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Daniel Kahneman. We’ll also provide concrete steps to overcome illogical thinking and explore why logical fallacies occur.</p>\n",

Hendricks asserts that, while we all have an innate call toward our most successful and fulfilling life, even highly successful people are often unable to achieve beyond a self-imposed limit, a “happiness threshold.” As you achieve greater success, Hendricks says you reach this threshold, which triggers self-sabotaging behaviors.</p>\n<p>Hendricks explains how our happiness thresholds are established early in life, through the adoption of false beliefs, and how to identify your own false beliefs. He offers practical advice for applying this new knowledge to your life and relationships, in order to take the “big leap” into living your best life.</p>\n<p>We’ll compare Hendricks’s ideas on happiness, limiting beliefs, and self-sabotage with those of other authors and experts, and we’ll explore the scientific research behind key concepts.</p>\n",

Through her analysis of common human biases, Konnikova demonstrates that a con artist doesn’t just rely on their own wiles—<strong>they rely on our instinctive confidence in the stories we tell <em>ourselves. </em></strong>Konnikova suggests that by understanding these manipulation tactics, we might learn to identify and extract ourselves from cons. In this guide, we’ll also include actionable advice for avoiding cons and explore how the manipulation tactics apply in more recent examples.</p>\n",

Psychotherapist Russ Harris believes this is a common state of affairs and calls it living in <em>the confidence gap</em>. He believes you can get beyond this gap by learning how to <em>relate</em> to your negative thoughts differently: Instead of letting them dictate your actions, recognize them as mere mental events and carry on pursuing your goals. You’ll never be able to rid yourself entirely of negative thoughts and fears, but you <em>can </em>change how you react to them.</p>\n<p>As we lay out Harris’s approach to relating productively to thoughts, we’ll provide alternative perspectives on how to achieve your goals that draw on spiritual teaching, as well as more traditional self-help methodologies.</p>\n",

He wrote <em>The Cost of Discipleship</em> as a wake-up call for the church, which he felt had rendered Christianity somewhat meaningless by making discipleship too “easy.” He lived as he preached—his Christian beliefs compelled him to speak out against Hitler’s regime and ultimately led to his execution in 1945. (He doesn’t discuss the Nazi ideology in this book, but he was openly critical of it, leading the Nazi Party to regard him as an enemy of the state.)</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll discuss Bonhoeffer’s teachings on discipleship, with additional historical and religious background and context to make them more accessible, even if you don’t have a strong background in Christian theology.</p>\n",

In turn, this causes you to live what other people want, rather than what you care about; resent other people's success since they take away from your luster; and think you're incompetent when you don't get someone else's approval, even if that approval is impossible to get.</p>\n<p>The book made waves in Asia before becoming a bestseller in the West. Kishimi is a licensed counselor and expert in Adlerian psychology. Koga, a professional business writer, proclaims himself the Plato to Kishimi’s Socrates, transcribing and transforming Kishimi’s insights into a more accessible form for the general public.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll outline Kishimi and Koga’s radical view of life—care less what other people think, and help others out of genuine personal enjoyment. We'll explain how you can use that to tap into the freedom and joy inherent in human existence. Along the way, we’ll provide additional information about Adlerian psychology and compare Kishimi and Koga’s advice to that in other popular self-help books.</p>\n",

To stop being led astray and made miserable by these false beliefs, Greene writes that we must become more attuned to reality—to the ways the world <em>actually </em>works and how people <em>actually </em>behave.

The book’s subtitle, <em>A Biography of Cancer</em>, reflects Mukherjee’s feeling that cancer is a living and evolving entity that fought modern medicine to a stalemate for centuries. Mukherjee, a doctor and biologist specializing in immunology (the study of the immune system) and oncology (the study of cancer), has spent much of his career on the front line of that fight. Though the book was first published in 2010, cancer remains a frightening disease that doctors are still working to understand and treat.</p>\n<p>Our guide provides context and background information for Mukherjee’s book, helping you to understand the more technical aspects of cancer and cancer treatment, as well as the significance behind major events in the fight against cancer.</p>\n",

They do so at their peril, stifling innovation and putting themselves in harm’s way.</p>\n<p>Edmondson, a professor of leadership and management, stumbled upon the concept of psychological safety while studying the relationship between teamwork and error rates in hospitals. She realized that groups that openly discussed failure without fear of repercussions warded off problems before they happened and took risks that fostered innovation.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we examine what psychological safety is, why it’s important, the detrimental effects of fear-driven work cultures, and ways leaders can cultivate psychologically safe environments to drive success.

The five dysfunctions are 1) absence of trust, 2) fear of conflict, 3) lack of commitment, 4) avoidance of accountability, and 5) inattention to results. Through identifying these root causes of poor teamwork, teams can develop specific strategies for overcoming each of them. By doing this, they will become comfortable with one another, be willing to engage in constructive debate, achieve clarity and buy-in around team priorities, hold one another to high standards, and focus on team results instead of individual ambition.</p>\n",

That all changed when he discovered the world of seduction and pickup artists (PUAs), a community of men who exchanged tips and advice for seducing women.</p>\n<p>Over the course of two years, Neil learned pickup lines, approach tactics, and even hypnosis from the top PUAs in the seduction community. Neil started picking up, dating, and having sex with more women than he’d ever imagined possible. But, over time, Neil realized that <strong>mastering the game wasn’t about memorizing lines and routines in order to get women into bed—it was about developing inner confidence.</strong></p>\n",

Your ideal self is constantly changing, making your goals impossible to reach.

This simple shift in thinking makes all the difference in living a happier life.</p>\n<p>This is the core principle of <em>The Gap and The Gain</em> and was developed by entrepreneurial coach Dan Sullivan. In the book, organizational psychologist Benjamin Hardy connects Sullivan’s ideas to scientific concepts that help explain <em>why</em> we tend to focus on the future, and <em>how</em> we can train ourselves to focus on the past instead. Hardy and Sullivan argue that making this change can drastically improve your quality of life. In this guide, we’ll elaborate on the psychological concepts that Hardy presents and discuss how empirical research has (or hasn’t) supported the book’s main ideas.</p>\n",

Beaubien and Leizrowice explore topics such as how humans are driven by algorithms, how to earn compound interest on your knowledge and skills, and how not to be fooled by randomness.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we organize <em>Volume 3</em>’s models into five broad themes: behavior, group dynamics, efficiency, long-term planning, and statistical thinking. As we explore each theme, we offer suggestions for how to put the book’s models into practice in your daily life.</p>\n",

In <em>The</em> <em>Immortality Key</em>, attorney and scholar Brian Muraresku argues that the origins of Christianity are rooted in the psychedelic rituals of ancient Greek life and that these rituals allowed people to embrace their mortality.</p>\n<p>Presenting a decade’s worth of research and evidence, Muraresku delves into the origins of Christianity, its overlap with pre-existing pagan customs, and its eventual diversion. Along the way, he asks how we might glean some wisdom from those ancient traditions to reconsider the place of psychedelics in the modern world—can a transcendent experience provide a <em>key</em> to our immortality?</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll discuss the evidence and arguments Muraresku presents about Christianity and its connection to Greek paganism, as well as his questions about what psychedelics have to offer humanity. We’ll also explore current research and varied viewpoints regarding the use of psychedelics for therapeutic purposes.</p>\n",

According to Zimbardo, we underestimate the potential for the circumstances of a given time and place to transform ordinary people into heartless killers. Not only does this misunderstanding cause many unsuspecting people to willingly participate in evil and abuse, it also prevents us from identifying and putting an end to true sources of evil.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll detail the various circumstantial factors that can influence people to hurt others, illustrating them with examples from Zimbardo’s firsthand account of the Stanford Prison Experiment.

Against this myth, McGilchrist argues that <strong>the right hemisphere is more important than the left hemisphere</strong>, and failure to recognize this fact threatens to rob our lives of meaning and happiness.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll examine the differences between the brain’s hemispheres, the reasons McGilchrist thinks the right hemisphere belongs in control, and the historical eras that he says illustrate power imbalances between the hemispheres. We’ll also examine McGilchrist’s predictions about a world dominated by the left hemisphere and his reasons for thinking this world would diminish our happiness. Throughout the guide, we’ll consider counterarguments from other experts in fields like history, philosophy, and literary criticism, and we’ll discuss updates since the book’s publication.</p>\n",

The book covers strategies for streamlining your process so that you can keep your staff working together smoothly and finish your most daunting projects on time.</p>\n<p>Brooks led the division of IBM that programmed computer operating systems in the 1960s, when computer programming was far less developed than it is now. He originally wrote <em>The Mythical Man-Month </em>as a management guide for the burgeoning software industry. However, managers from diverse fields began adopting his strategies, turning his work into a business classic.</p>\n<p>Our guide explores Brooks's strategies while updating them with comparisons to today’s management advice. We also discuss how his thinking has evolved alongside the rapidly changing computer industry. Along the way, you'll learn why it's so hard to make accurate scheduling estimates, how adding more staff to a late project can make it even later, and how to manage the inevitable errors that arise from managing teams performing complex tasks.</p>\n",

The result is effectively racial subjugation and disenfranchisement.</p>\n<p>In this summary, you’ll learn how the war on drugs followed a pattern of implementation consistent with slavery and Jim Crow, how financial incentives and legal protection allow selective targeting of black males for drug crimes, and why it’s so difficult for drug convicts to reintegrate into society.</p>\n",

Fung challenges this view, laying out a comprehensive theory of obesity as a hormonal disorder that <em>causes</em> overeating, rather than the other way around.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we unpack Fung’s theory of obesity, which he developed after observing the weight gain that insulin caused in his diabetic patients, along with his solution for overcoming it. In this guide, we’ll show why dieting doesn’t work and why exercise actually has little impact on weight loss. We’ll explore how the body processes food, learn why not all carbs are bad, and discover which foods to avoid at all costs. In addition, we’ll compare Fung’s ideas with perspectives from similar books on obesity, including <em>Why We Get Fat </em>and <em>Salt Sugar Fat</em>.</p>\n",

Keller and co-author Jay Papasan explain how to determine your goal or life purpose, then focus intensely on getting there, while avoiding pitfalls such as multitasking, relying on an unprioritized to-do list, thinking too small, misunderstanding willpower and discipline, and neglecting your personal life. When you know and focus exclusively on the most important thing every day, everything else falls into place. Extraordinary focus on One Thing brings extraordinary success.</p>\n",

Receiving good grades impacts career success, and as a result, the education system expects school to be students’ top priority despite their non-academic obligations. This pressure often makes young people chronically overwhelmed, and they consequently struggle to perform well in school. However, in <em>The Only Study Guide You’ll Ever Need, </em>Jade Bowler explains that school doesn’t have to be this way. If students learn how to effectively manage their mindset, study habits, and time, they can minimize their stress and live a balanced life while <em>excelling</em> in school.</p>\n<p>This guide will discuss how to manage your mindset so that prominent issues like fear of failure, lack of motivation, and procrastination don’t sabotage your success. We’ll also discuss science-backed time management and study techniques that will help you ace your exams. Throughout the guide, we’ll supplement Bowler’s advice with recommendations from productivity experts like Neil A. Fiore (<em>The Now Habit) </em>and David Allen (<em>Getting Things Done</em>).</p>\n",

Seth Godin’s<em> The Practice</em> dismantles the long-standing myth that creativity requires a special kind of “magic.” Godin argues that making creative work doesn’t require genius, lightning bolts of inspiration, or even confidence. Instead, creativity is a skill that can be learned. To be successful in creative endeavors, you simply need to maintain a consistent practice of creating and sharing your work with others. In this <em>New York Times </em>best seller, Godin tells you just how to do that.</p>\n<p>Our guide contrasts Godin’s advice with other popular approaches to creativity, such as those found in Elizabeth Gilbert’s <em><a href=\"https://www.shortform.com/app/book/big-magic/1-page-summary\" target=\"_blank\">Big Magic</a></em> and Austin Kleon’s <em><a href=\"https://www.shortform.com/app/book/steal-like-an-artist\" target=\"_blank\">Steal Like an Artist</a></em>. In addition, we take a look at some creative habits of working artists to determine how they line up with the practices advocated by Godin.</p>\n",

And in doing so, they provided the cultural and financial impetus for capitalism to become a full-fledged economic system.</p>\n<p>In our guide to <em>The Protestant Ethic</em>, we’ll break down Weber’s argument about the origins and effects of the Protestant way of life and its connection to capitalism. In commentary, we’ll discuss how Weber’s argument relates to Marxism, dive into the theological and historical details, and highlight related arguments about the origins of capitalism.</p>\n",

The authors bring a wide range of expertise to the book, including clinical psychology, business psychology, journalism, writing and editing, and music.</p>\n<p>In our guide, we’ll explore the origins of psychology before moving chronologically through six major fields: behaviorism, psychoanalysis, cognitive psychology, social psychology, developmental psychology, and differential psychology.

Consequently, liberals and conservatives lack a common language, and reason-based arguments about morality are ineffective.

In <em>The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self</em>, Carl Trueman argues that cultural developments of the past three centuries have transformed our conception of selfhood—from a self rooted in religion, tradition, and community to one rooted in individualism, emotion, and sexuality. A professor of biblical studies and ecclesiastical history, Trueman asserts that this change has been disastrous for Western culture because it undermines traditional Christian understandings of marriage, gender, and authority while stigmatizing Christian beliefs as bigoted and irrational.</p>\n<p>Our guide will explore Trueman's historical analysis, from the philosophy of the Enlightenment to the rise of the LGBTQ+ alliance and the student activism of the left. You'll read about 19th-century English poetry, the rise of internet pornography, and Sigmund Freud's take on childhood sexuality. Our commentary also dives into the historical context of these developments while exploring multiple perspectives on the culture wars of today.</p>\n",

Why do we constantly find ourselves in unfulfilling relationships, hating our jobs, and rubbing people the wrong way—and not knowing why? The authors of <em>The School of Life </em>have an answer: because you lack emotional intelligence. According to them, we’re not taught how to understand and cope with our feelings and the feelings of others, and this leads us to make poor decisions and to be miserable. However, by developing emotional intelligence across several realms of life, you can better understand yourself and lead a happier life.</p>\n<p><em>The School of Life </em>is an educational organization that offers materials to support personal growth. Several of its authors collaborated on this book. In this guide, we’ll discuss the authors’ argument that we don’t have emotional intelligence and examine how they say you can gain emotional intelligence about yourself, others, relationships, and work. We’ll supplement this with scientific research that backs up or contradicts some of the authors’ claims, and with insights from other self-help authors on ways to implement the authors’ advice.</p>\n",

Our souls have incarnated in order to learn lessons and fulfill a mission, and ultimately to evolve. Therefore, Zukav says, our true life’s purpose is to become fully aligned with our souls in order to help them evolve. However, humans have become disconnected from our spiritual nature, and this causes much sorrow and suffering in the world. Zukav says we need to tune into our souls and to messages from the universe and our spirit guides, so we can fulfill our soul’s mission and aid in its evolution.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll compare Zukav’s ideas with those of other spiritual and New-Age thinkers, like Deepak Chopra and Eckhart Tolle, and to the religious traditions and concepts that Zukav’s philosophy draws upon, most notably Hinduism.</p>\n",

That’s the question relationship researcher John Gottman (along with co-author Nan Silver) answers in <em>The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work</em>—a step-by-step blueprint to cultivating a happier, emotionally fulfilling marriage. Gottman’s expertise stems from his research at the Love Lab, a laboratory at the University of Washington in Seattle devoted to deciphering the secrets of happy couples.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll explain why becoming genuine friends with your spouse is essential to your marital happiness and how you can improve your marital friendship by following four principles. Then, we’ll describe how fighting can increase your risk of divorce—and which relationship behaviors Gottman relies on to predict divorce with 91% accuracy. We’ll also share Gottman’s three principles for learning to handle conflict effectively. Along the way, we’ll compare Gottman’s advice to that of other relationship experts and share further strategies to implement Gottman’s suggestions.</p>\n",

However, he also suggests that we can mitigate these thinking errors (and thus improve our forecasts) with the help of a method called Bayesian inference.

In this work, he suggests social scientists act as educators—explaining society-wide problems to the people living within that society. He argues that this education is necessary to combat political apathy and inspire social and political change.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll explain Mills’s theory of how social science can preserve freedom, as well as his critiques of other social science approaches.

            "blurb": "<p>In his bestselling book <em>The Sports Gene</em>, David Epstein uses science to support the claim that our genes play a determining role in our success in sports. He opens by refuting the idea that enough practice is a virtual guarantee of success. He then spends the rest of the book citing research on genes and performance, taking the reader around the world and over evolutionary time, all to explain why the book’s title is an impossibility. There is no single “sports gene,” just as there is no “perfect athlete.” There are, however, fortuitous pairings of the right genes and the right circumstances in the right sports that together create the remarkable and diverse feats of athleticism that we see on the elite stage.</p>\n<p>Our guide reorganizes the wealth of content in <em>The Sports Gene</em> by theme to help clarify Epstein’s major arguments. To provide more grounding, our commentary includes supplemental research as well as explanations of scientific concepts in the fields of genetics and evolution.</p>\n",

This leads us to pursue emotional highs that don’t lead to lasting happiness.</p>\n<p>The solutions are counterintuitive and include: be wrong, fail, tolerate feeling bad, accept pain, practice rejection. Because we can’t care equally about everything, we need to prioritize and focus on what brings us happiness and meaning. In other words, we need to carefully choose what we give our f*cks about.</p>\n<p>The book<em> </em>draws from several established philosophies (Stoicism, Existentialism, and Buddhism), and we’ll expand and clarify the book’s messages by tracing their origins to these schools of thought. We’ll also explore some of the psychology behind what motivates people’s decisions, and why we’re driven to give so many f*cks about so many unimportant things.</p>\n",

Kelly McGonigal argues that stress isn’t the enemy it’s typically made out to be—rather, it’s an ally we should embrace. By changing your mindset on stress, McGonigal claims you can transform it into a resource that leads to enhanced health, greater success, and a more meaningful life.</p>\n<p>McGonigal is a health psychologist and professor at Stanford University. She teaches that when it comes to transforming stress, key mindset shifts—like viewing stress as normal and focusing on helping others in order to help yourself—make all the difference.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll see what ancient philosophers and modern stress experts have to say about the influence of your mindset on stress. We’ll also look deeper into the studies that support McGonigal’s argument and reconcile her research with updates in psychological literature. Finally, we’ll discuss practical ways to apply McGonigal’s ideas in your daily life.</p>\n",

In this new world, free markets reign supreme, global trade is the centerpiece of economies, and people have access to more information and are more connected than ever before. The global playing field has evened out. In other words, the world has become flat.</p>\n<p>In <em>The World Is Flat</em>, New York Times writer Thomas L.

We don’t always think in terms of risk, and maybe that’s why we’re prone to making irrational decisions. <strong>But what if we worked on keeping risk at the forefront of our minds?</strong></p>\n<p>Annie Duke discusses how her decades-long poker career helped her develop decision-making strategies based on the idea that all decisions are bets. Being immersed in the game enabled her to observe how people make decisions in a setting where every choice leads to a clear outcome—winning or losing money. That’s what a bet is: a decision with quantifiable risk. In our guide to <em>Thinking in Bets</em>, you’ll find out how to work around your biases, objectively evaluate your beliefs, learn from your past, and ultimately get better at making good decisions.</p>\n",

Therefore, no matter how much time we spend studying the market, we’ll fail to establish a pattern of winning. To achieve consistent success, we need to train ourselves to think differently<em> </em>and embody the winning mindset, and Douglas tells us how.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll present the mental barriers that Douglas says we need to overcome and the core beliefs we need to internalize to trade successfully. We’ll also examine research in psychology, biology, and finance that explores these concepts. Along the way, you’ll learn practical steps to reduce interference from negative thoughts so you can start accumulating wins (and profits).</p>\n",

Trauma, loss, and suffering are everyday realities, damaging not only to those who suffer from these challenges directly, but also to the caregivers who witness and tend to others’ trauma. Lipsky argues that to be fully present and emotionally available to others, we must address the impact of secondary trauma (the harm we experience when exposed to others’ trauma). Lipsky's trauma stewardship framework addresses how to manage secondary trauma, create a better work-life balance, and practice mindful self-care so you can support others to your fullest capacity.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll explain Lipsky’s concept of trauma stewardship, discuss the warning signs of secondary trauma, and provide ways you can replenish your energy for healthy caregiving.

The story of Louie’s struggles as a young loner, a rising star, a Pacific POW, and a man trying to reclaim his life after years of torment is as unbelievable as it is inspiring. Through Louie’s tale, the depths of the human soul and will to survive are examined. As Louie spirals out of control because of trauma and becomes obsessed with a plot to kill the man who tortured him, he learns that a man is not defined by his history, but rather by the manner in which he seeks a future. <em>Unbroken</em> reaches into the heart of terror and shines a light on what it means to triumph.</p>\n",

But according to Dr. Judson Brewer, <strong>you can recognize and counteract anxiety using mindfulness—the practice of paying close attention to the present moment without analyzing or judging it. </strong></p>\n<p>In <em>Unwinding Anxiety</em>, Brewer explains how anxiety becomes a habit and how it spawns additional habits that only make things worse. Brewer draws on his background as a psychiatrist, neuroscientist, and mindfulness researcher to show why mindfulness succeeds where traditional methods like willpower, substitution, and avoidance fail.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll walk through Brewer’s three-step method for treating anxiety while expanding on the techniques he mentions and offering some additional psychological insights from experts such as Daniel Goleman and Brené Brown.</p>\n",

According to Rodgers, women succumb to myths and stereotypes that prevent them from earning more.

By following Rodgers’s advice, you can become more financially confident, grow your wealth, and live with more freedom and autonomy.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll discuss ways to develop a positive money mindset, manage your time and energy, and increase your wealth by recognizing the worth of your work. We’ll also compare Rodgers’s advice with that of other entrepreneurs and financial experts and provide practical tips on how to implement her strategies.</p>\n",

Sandel argues that market values have become society’s dominant moral framework, the lens through which we determine what is important or unimportant as well as right and wrong. Sandel warns that the logic and incentives of markets—where there’s no limit on what’s for sale as long as someone’s willing to buy it, and individual self-interest trumps the common good—have supplanted older value systems which held that some things were too important to be subject to the forces of supply and demand. He writes that this triumph of market values has had severe moral and social consequences.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we explore Sandel’s chief moral objections to the market society—that markets inevitably lead to the inequitable distribution of essential goods, services, and experiences, and that the dominance of market values and market-based thinking corrupts our moral, civic, and social virtues. We also balance out Sandel’s perspective on market values with commentary from pro-capitalist writers who make the moral case <em>for </em>markets.</p>\n",

He offers guidance on how we can use these patterns to be strategic about our time, from being more efficient at work to taking advantage of momentum at important turning points in our lives. <strong><em>When </em>is a handbook for those who want to harness the natural rhythm of their day and their lives to work and live more intentionally.</strong></p>\n<p>Throughout the guide, we’ll expand on the science behind Pink’s recommendations, adding advice from other researchers in the fields of well-being and productivity, while also highlighting studies that challenge some of Pink’s assertions.</p>\n",

Later, when she regained her left-brain cognitive functions, she also retained a connection to the right side of her brain that brought her profound inner peace.</p>\n<p>Taylor’s key insight from her experience is that <strong>we can <em>choose </em>to access different parts of our brains and interrupt automatic thought processes and emotional reactions that don’t serve us</strong>. She links four areas of the brain to the “four characters within us”—each with their own ways of perceiving and navigating the world. In this guide, we’ll explore how the four characters show up in our lives and how to achieve emotional well-being by getting to know our four characters better.

This will probably require a mindset shift, but, according to Sullivan, it’s the quickest way to achieve stellar outcomes.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll discuss how investing in personnel gives you better results faster, allows you to reclaim your valuable time, and maximizes your income. We’ll also explore how leveraging the power of personnel in your private life as well as your professional life improves your relationships and expands your sense of purpose.

Specifically, our partisan <em>political </em>identities have become overarching <em>super-identities</em> that encompass and activate our most deeply felt personal, religious, linguistic, socioeconomic, and ethnic/racial identities. In today’s America, these underlying lines of division all come together in one <em>main </em>division—between Democrats and Republicans—that makes bipartisan cooperation increasingly difficult.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we explore the origins of modern political polarization and its differing impact on the two major political parties, how polarization has made American politics a winner-take-all struggle, and ideas for how we might depolarize our politics. We also supplement Klein’s ideas and analysis with commentary from other political scholars and analysts and explore additional perspectives that both support and challenge Klein.</p>\n",

Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and the first outside investor in Facebook, argues that technology has stagnated. Most new companies improve incrementally on existing products, but Thiel argues that the most valuable and game-changing startups create something new. They move the world from <em>zero</em> to <em>one</em>. Creating new things is not only the best path to profits—it’s also the only path for human progress. In this guide, we’ll compare Thiel’s perspective with W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne’s <em>Blue Ocean Strategy</em>, Geoffrey Moore’s strategy for high-tech startups, and the insights of other innovation experts.</p>\n",
